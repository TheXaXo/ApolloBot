# ApolloBot

ApolloBot simplifies many of the mundane tasks people perform on Instagram. It has a distinct feature set made really easy to use with many configurable options. The main features of ApolloBot are:

1. Showing the people not following you back.
2. Showing who has unfollowed you since your last check.
3. Global queue search.
4. Showing who has viewed any of your last active stories. Combined with the search functionality you can easily know if a specific person has watched your story. Keep in mind that at time of writing this there is bug on Instagram's part and this functionality does not work. The extension will be updated ASAP when Instagram fixes this.
5. Removing specific people in the queue you don't want to unfollow even if they don't follow you back.
6. Last but not least a batch unfollow functionality with configurable timeouts.
