# Features
The main features of ApolloBot are the following:

1. Loading the followers and following of the current page. The range of users loaded can be specified.
2. Load the people not following back.
3. Load the people who have unfollowed since the last check.
4. Global users queue search by username and full name.
5. Showing who has viewed any of your last active stories. Combined with the search functionality you can easily know if a specific person has watched your story. Keep in mind that at the time of writing this there is bug on Instagram™'s part and this functionality does not work. The extension will be updated ASAP when Instagram fixes this.
6. Removing specific people from the queue who you for example don't want to unfollow even if they don't follow you back.
7. Saving and loading queues in order to be processed later.
8. Basic and advanced settings allowing you to configure the timeouts, timeout randomization and even the queue hashes in case Instagram™ changes their APIs.

There are 2 modes for processing the users queue toggled by clicking on the dots on the left of the main button:

1. Start Following - by selecting this mode a pop-up will appear with options to skip private accounts and select if you want to like any of the latest photos automatically.
2. Start Unfollowing - every user in the queue will be unfollowed.

# How to use
To use the extension just open Instagram™ and a new icon will appear on the top right corner. Go to your or another profile page and click the icon.
